# CircuitBreaker
Local (offline) repository for CircuitMaker

Removed for legal reasons.
CircuitBreaker added a lot of System and Program security loopholes (CircuitMaker uses the Mozilla Engine)
to hook into the functionality of CircuitMaker.
Also as CircuitStudio was released with payable Content, CircuitBreaker could be modified and used to circumvent the payment option.
